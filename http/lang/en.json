The bake a cake project is a sequential project; you can't bake the cake before you buy the ingredients and you can't buy the ingredients before you find a recipe.</p><p>A <strong>parallel project</strong> is a project whose actions can be completed in any order. For example, a pay bills project whose actions are pay rent, pay cell phone bill, pay water bill, etc. This project would be considered parallel because it doesn't matter what order you pay your bills in; it just matters that they all are completed.</p><p>A <strong>single action list</strong> is a special kind of project that usually consists of projects with only one step to complete or an assortment of related actions (like, buy groceries). Often times, it is helpful to create a miscellaneous project to keep things organized.</p><p>Create products manually or begin by importing products from an existing database.</p>"
